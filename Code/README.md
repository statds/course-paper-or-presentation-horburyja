Data analysis and processing are all done in jupyter notebook file called "exploratory analysis" which is in the "Code" directory. The raw data is loaded from the original dataset, provided by Leite, which comprises over 10000 chess games played by Hans Niemann. Each block is divided logically between steps, and comments are provided where necessary.

# Warning

Because of the significant size of the dataset, if you try and reproduce my results it will take a while and put significant strain on your computer. Be warned that doing this repeatedly can adversly affect your computer's hardware. If a high performance computer is available, it is recommended that it be used.
